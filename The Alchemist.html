      <li><em>Theme 4</em>: Unity of SpiritThe Alchemist demonstrates the concept of the Soul of the World to clarify that all the religions agree about this presence of the soul.

Melchizedek’s words that when a person intends upon doing something, the whole world seems to conspire to stand by him stands true in his case. He discovers it when transforming the wind into a storm to fulfill his prediction.</li>
      <li><em>Theme 6</em>: Wisdom and Knowledge - According to the author, true wisdom is to know how to turn lead into gold.

This wisdom lies in knowing the Soul of the World and aligning the Personal Legend with this Universal Soul.</li>
      <li><em>Theme 7</em>: Selfishness - Selfishness is a minor theme of the novel. Narcissus’ and the lake’s selfishness were obvious. Later it reappears in the novel through different characters in the shape of Personal Legend. As every person has his own desire to fulfill even if he comes across another person.

      <li><em>Theme 8</em>: Religion - Santiago dreams about the treasure in the church. He abandons his religious duties and starts following his dream to achieve his Personal Legend. Besides his religious upbringing and learning to read, he doesn’t believe the written knowledge is useful. This religious debate entails that religion is important, but the experience of the world is more important to lead a successful life.</li>
      <li><em>Theme 9</em>: Spirituality - The ideas of the Soul of the World, Personal Legends, and mysticism point to the thematic strand of spirituality that runs parallel to other themes in the novel. In fact, the entire adventurous quest of Santiago is a spiritual quest to discover his soul following his dreams.></li>
      <li><em>Theme 10</em>: Omens - Although omens play an important role in our lives, in the novel, they have a specific role. They are central to their actions. When Melchizedek gives Santiago two precious stones, he is actually handing him the power to see good or bad omens and act accordingly></li>
